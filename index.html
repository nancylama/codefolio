    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nancy, and 
      I am a student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, studying Mathematics 
      and Computer Science. This portfolio showcases the projects I've completed in my 
      courses and personal learning. I have a strong passion for tackling challenges and 
      utilizing technology to find solutions.
